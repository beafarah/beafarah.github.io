PhD student under the supervision of [Olivier Bouaziz](https://obouaziz.github.io/) and [Aurélien Latouche](https://curie.fr/personne/aurelien-latouche).

I study Biostatistics and Survival Analysis.

After I completed my undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in 2021, I was awarded the Eiffel Excellence scholarship to pursue a double-degree program at ENSAE Paris, where I obtained a master's degree in Data Science, Statistics, and Machine Learning. This led me to an internship with Olivier Bouaziz and Aurélien Latouche from March 2023 to September 2023, focusing on survival analysis. 

Since October 2023, I have been continuing this work, which focuses on the design of randomized clinical trials using survival quantiles in the presence of censored data.
