  abstract={A nonparametric test for equality of quantiles in the presence of right-censored data is studied. We propose to construct an asymptotic test statistic for the comparison of one quantile between two treatment groups, as well as for the comparison of a collection of quantiles. Under the null hypothesis of equality of quantiles, the test statistic follows asymptotically a normal distribution in the univariate case and a chi-square with J degrees of freedom in the multivariate case, with J the number of quantiles compared. Deriving the variance of the test statistic requires the estimation of the probability density function of the distribution of failure times at the quantile being tested. A resampling method is presented as an alternative to kernel density estimation to perform such task. Extensive simulation studies are performed to show that the proposed approach provides reasonable type I probabilities and powers. We illustrate the proposed test in a phase III randomized clinical trial where the proportional hazards assumption between treatment arms does not hold.},
